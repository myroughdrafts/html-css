One Page HTML

I tried to write HTML in a single page, I hope it will help in understanding HTML quickly.

==============================

<!doctype> element: it stands for document type. It should be declared at the very beginning of HTML source code.
Example:
<!doctype html>

==============================

HTML is case-insensitive language, you could write <!DOCTYPE HTML> as well, but it is always good to stick with one writing style.

==============================

Root element <html>: after <!doctype> declaration is made, the root element starts; and everything comes in between opening and closing of root element.
Example:
<!doctpe html>
<html>
... 
</html>

==============================

Attribute "lang": "lang" stands for language, it is declared in root element.
Example:
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
...
</html>

==============================

<head> element: after root element, <head> element starts; and between opening and closing of head element many things such as metadata, title, link, stylesheet, and javascript come.
Example:
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>Learning about Head element </title>
<meta name="keywords" content=" some keywords">
<link rel="canonical" href="url type you prefer">
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
<style>
body {background-color:#ddd;}
</style>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

==============================

<body> element: after closing of </head> element, <body> element starts. And betwen <body></body> element comes 99% HTML: paragraph, image, audio, video, table, form, map and so forth.

==============================

Slash in HTML: "/" forward slash is used.

==============================

Comment in HTML: a web-browser doesn't display HTML comments if they are wrapped in between <!-- and -->. It can be used for single as well as multiple lines.
Example 1:
<!-- This is html comment -->
Example 2:
<!-- This
is
also
html comment -->

==============================

<main> element: it doesn't come inside <article>, <header>, <aside>, <footer> and so forth; but all can come inside it.

==============================

<aritcle> element: like an article in newspaper which contains <header>, images, <aside>, <footer> etc.,
example:
<article>
<header> <h1> Two women </h1></header>
<h3> First woman </h3>
<img src=" " alt=" ">
<p> Story about first woman [...] </p>
<h3> Second woman </h3>
<img src="" alt=" ">
<p> Story about second woman [...] </p>
<footer>
<h1> Few words </h1>
<p> blah blah blah [...] </footer>
</article> 

==============================

<header> element: don't get it confused with <head></head>. It shouldn't contain long content, but it should contain thing like heading, search box, menu, ads. Check above example.

==============================

<section> element: it generally works as a child of <article></article>, <header></header>, <aside></aside> and <footer></footer>; it purpose is to put a "section (division) in a content.
Example:
<footer>
<section>
<h4> Social </h4>
<p> Social links [...]</p>
</section>
<section>
<nav>>
<h4> Menu </h4> 
<p> Internal links [...]</p>
</nav>
</section>
</footer>

==============================

<nav> element: internal navigation of a site, you may put it in <header></header>, <aside></aside>, or <footer> </footer>. Or wherever you want.
Example:
<header>
<nav> 
<h4>Menu </h4>
<ul>
<li> <a href="home.html"> Home </a> </li>
<li> <a href="about.html"> About </a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
</header>

==============================

<hgroup> element: it is used for grouping headings (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6). I only use it when I put more than one heading together. When between two headings come bigger piece of content, then I don't use <hgroup></hgroup>
Example:
<header>
<hgroup>
<h1> Marketing Blog </h1>
<h5> I help people learn marketing </h5>
</hgroup>
</header>

==============================

<figure>, <figcaption> elements: this combination of elements help in giving "a caption" to an image.
Example:
<figure>
<img src=" " alt=" ">
<figcaption>A simpl image</figcaption>
</figure>

==============================

<aside> element: this element may work in plenty of ways, like, pull-quote or sidebar; to give links or ads within content.
Example:
<html>
<head>
<title> </title>
<style>
article {max-width:300px;}
aside {float:right; max-width:200px;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<article>
<p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor. </p>
<aside> <h1> Green dot movemment </h1></aside>
<p> Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. </p>
</article
</body>
</html>

==============================

<p> element: this element stands for paragraph, whatever paragrah you type, each paragraph comes in between <p></p>. That's so simple.

==============================

<ins>, <del>, <datetime> and <cite> elements: <ins> stands for insertion, <del> stands for deletion, and <cite> stands for reference. And <datetime> is easy to understand, its format is: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM-HH:MM (the last HH:MM is to set time zone).
Example:
<p> My name is <del>Tond</del><ins datetime="2050-12-31T23:11-5:00" cite="http://example.com/original.html"> Bond, James Bond.</ins></p>

==============================

<dfn>, <abbr>, <kbd>, <var> and <samp> elements: <dfn> stands for defining instace of a term, and <abbr> stands for abbreviaton and uses title=" " attribte for fullform. <kbd> element is used for keyboard keys, example 2; <var> is used for variable, example 3; and <samp> is used for computer generated sample output, example 4.
Example 1:

<ol>, <ul>, and <dl> elements: <ol> stands for ordered list; <ul> stands for unordered list; and <dl> stands for description list. Let's see how they work:
Example for <ol>:
<ol>
<li> America </li>

</ol>
Example for <ul>:

<div> element: this is most loved and most used block element. You can put any number of <div> inside <div>; but try to use <header>, <article>, <aside>, <section>, <footer> elements where-ever they are needed. Don't use <div> element so ruthlessly.
Example:
<div> anything in between </div>

Embedded elements: <img>, img map, <iframe>, <embed>, <object>, <param>, <video>, <audio>, <source>, <track>, <media>, <mathml>, <svg>. Let's take each one of them by an example and explanation.
Example of <img> element:
<img src=" " alt=" " height=" " width =" ">
Example of img map elements:

<map name="wow">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,50,50" href="http://example.com/">
<area shape="rect" coords="50,0,200,200" href="http://example.org/">
</map>
Combo of img and map elements is used to link different part of an image. Pls note that hash (#) is used in <img> element and not in <map> element. Attributes "usemap" and "name" both help in linking <img> element to <map> element.
Example of <Iframe> element:
it embeds other webpage into your webpage.
<iframe src="http://example.com" height="600px" width="600px"></iframe>
Example of <embed> element:
Preferably used for embedding flash.
<embed src="somefile.swf">
Example of <object> element:
It works something like <iframe> / <embed>
<object data=" " type= " ">
Example of <param> element:
<param> stands of parameter.
<object data="xyzfile.wav">
<param name="autoplay" value="false">
<param name="controller" value="true">
</object>
Example of <video> element:
This element is used for embedding video on a webpage.
<video src="thisfile.mp4" controls width=" " height=" "></video>

<source src="thisfile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<source src="thisfile.ogv" type="video/ogg">
</video>
Note: <source> element is used for fallback purpose for <audio> and <video>, when one format doesn't run, it opts for alternate given format.

<a>, <link>, and <area> elements:

<a href="www.example.com"> some text </a>

<table> element: main child elements of <table> are <caption>, <tr>, and <td>; <tr> stands for row (horizontal), and <td> stands for column.
Example:
<table border="1">
<caption> my table & chair </caption>
<tr><td> first chair </td><td> second chair </td></tr>
<table>

==============================

<form> element: here I used <fieldset> and <legend> for decorating a form. <label> help selecting input-field, when you click on the "Name"; attribute "autofocus" helps input-field to get selected just by itself; attribute "placeholder" suggests a text hint to a user; attribute "required" displays a hint that input-field must be filed, and a user can't go ahead without filling it. Attribute "disabled" disable a form. Or you can use "disabled" attribute in the submit button: <input type="submit" disabled>.
Example:
<form>
<fieldset>
<legend>Fill in the form</legend>
<p> <label>Name: <input type="text" autofocus placeholder="Pls write your name" required disabled></label></p>
<p> <input type="submit"></p>
</fieldset>
</form>

==============================

THE END.
